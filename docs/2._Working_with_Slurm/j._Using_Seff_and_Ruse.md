# Using `seff` and `ruse`

The **Seff tool** is a powerful command-line utility designed to provide users with detailed efficiency 
statistics for jobs run on a Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) workload manager. 
It allows users to quickly assess how effectively their computing resources were utilized during job execution. 
By offering metrics such as memory usage, CPU efficiency, and runtime, Seff enables users to optimize their workflows, ensuring that computational resources are used as efficiently as possible. 
This tool is particularly valuable in high-performance computing environments where resource management and job efficiency are critical.

The **Ruse tool** is a specialized command-line utility for the Slurm workload manager, designed to provide users with insights into the resource usage of their jobs. 
By analyzing various metrics such as memory consumption, CPU utilization, and GPU efficiency, Ruse helps users understand how their jobs are consuming resources in a high-performance computing environment. 
This tool aids in optimizing job configurations by offering detailed reports, enabling users to make informed decisions to enhance resource efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall computational performance on Slurm-managed clusters.
