# Operating System Packages

The HPC environment is built on [Rocky Linux 8](https://rockylinux.org/) as the base operating system. A full suite of OS supplied software is installed, including most expected Linux/Unix tools, several desktop environments, Office and Internet applications and development libraries and tools. 

Where there is an option to install a package using a supported RPM for [Rocky Linux 8](https://rockylinux.org/), this is the preferred way to get the application into the cluster environment. 

*Note:* Rocky Linux, and enterprise Linux distributions in general, will have packages that might be a little bit older than other Linux distributions. [Please request software installation](/A._Contact_Us) if a newer packages is needed than available in the base operating system
