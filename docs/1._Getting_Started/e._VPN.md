# VPN

GlobalProtect is a comprehensive VPN (Virtual Private Network) system developed by Palo Alto Networks, designed to provide secure remote access to an organization's network resources. 
It offers robust protection by encrypting data traffic between remote users and the corporate network, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure during transmission. 
GlobalProtect integrates seamlessly with Palo Alto Networks' next-generation firewalls, enabling consistent security policies across all endpoints, whether they are on or off the corporate network. 
This system is particularly valued for its ability to extend enterprise-level security to remote workers and mobile devices, enhancing overall network security posture.
