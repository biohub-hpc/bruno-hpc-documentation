# Connecting with Open OnDemand

## Overview
Each site's resources are made available via [Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/). 

The [Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) interface provides a graphical, web-based entry point to access the cluster resources. You can submit and monitor your jobs, see their output, check the current status of the queue, run Jupyter notebooks, and much more. 

It additionally provides a web based terminal that contains shell environment similar to `ssh`, ansd graphical tools for managing files/data. 

The most powerful features of [Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) are the interactive site applications 

We support a few on the Bruno compute cluster.

## Connecting

The OnDemand interface requires the same type of authentication for connecting to Bruno via `ssh`. 

You will recieve a DUO, authentication form, where you will be prompted to enter your Okta credentials. 

It will afterwards go through the regular two-step authentication process.

The Dashboard will present itself, and from there you can select the menus across the top of the page to manage files, produce a shell, submit jobs or open interactive apps like; Jupyter Notebooks or RStudio.


## Virtual Network Desktop Connections

The OnDemand interface on Bruno, and other CZ-Biohub affiliated sites, support virtual network desktop connections. This is conducted through the OnDemand 

noVNC, and NoMachine when integrated with the Open OnDemand (OOD) interface, offers a seamless and efficient way for users to access and interact with remote desktop environments directly from their web browsers.

With these applications users can run graphical full graphical programs, in a linux desktop environment, on the HPC system. It offers the same ease as if a person were working on a local desktop.
